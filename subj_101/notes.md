Instructions: add "we are showing the combinations of color shape …"

add "there are 9 screens"

add "targets don’t have to be on the same screen"

dimension screen number is ambiguous

wrong stimuli marked by feedback: small vs medium

correct number of trials at feedback might be wrong

multiple dim target (screen 7 & top center)

BOTH condition partial condition generation should be 50%

report items feature trials: generated target does not match all the dimensions given

counterbalance the archetypes in the pilot phase

remove underscore in the buttons

“report whether the item is …”

feedback location and screen number

typo: following

add button counters

a/an in binary archetype (an E)

binary: total dim 3 or 4

multiple: at least 3 dims

add breaks per 10 tasks

look at task 22

binary not discarding properly (task 25)

binary target matching mechanism not correct (no small item except the targets 27)

ANY with four items is hard

Orange might be too similar to red and yellow

look at task 29, 30, 34, 35, 39

fix orientation in stimulus description

40 trials too long? maybe 30
